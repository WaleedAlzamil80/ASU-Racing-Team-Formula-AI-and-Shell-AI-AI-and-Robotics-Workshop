This online test is aiming to test your ability to search and self-study in technical topics that you
may know or don’t know about, feel free to get help from the internet, doctors, teaching
assistants, textbooks, or whatever source you find available to you (but you can’t work on this
mission with others that are also planning to attend this workshop)
Please read all the questions carefully and provide your answers in a single pdf file, aid
your answers with figures, graphs, or sketches if needed.
Please don’t be intimidated if you find the questions hard, we don’t expect you to solve most of
them; the goal is to expose you to some of the topics that will be explained in greater depth in
the workshop and measure your research skills, so do your best and (more importantly) try to
learn along the way.
